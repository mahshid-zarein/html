        popularity of <i>mobile gaming</i> has increased rapidly over the years, thanks

      <p>
        The quality of your smartphone’s display is crucial for an immersive
        gaming experience. With that in mind, when you’re looking for a gaming
        phone that will suit all your gaming needs, be sure to look out for the
        screen-to-body ratio, as well as display resolution. Some of the best
        displays include Full HD+, Super Retina, and OLED – which offer a
        vibrancy that’s perfect for gaming, especially when paired with minimal
        bezels.
